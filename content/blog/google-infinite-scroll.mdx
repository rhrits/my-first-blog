**Google Stops Using Infinite Scroll in Search Results**



In a significant change to how we navigate search results, Google has decided to discontinue the infinite scroll function. This feature, akin to the endless streams of content seen on social media, was first introduced to mobile devices in October 2021 and later to desktop computers at the end of 2022. However, Google has now removed infinite scrolling from desktop computers and plans to do the same for mobile devices in the coming months. The primary reasons for this change are to enhance user experience and optimize search engine performance.

### Why the Change?

A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land that the decision to eliminate infinite scrolling stems from concerns related to page load speed. Continuous scrolling can slow down the initial load times as the search engine pre-loads results that users might never reach. By returning to a traditional "button" interface with a paginated layout, Google aims to provide a more convenient experience, allowing users to move between pages of search results more quickly and efficiently.

Instead of the endless scroll, users can now click the "Next" button to navigate to subsequent pages. This change is expected to enhance user control over their search journey, making it easier to find and access the most relevant information without unnecessary delays.

### Impact on Mobile Devices

On mobile devices, Google is replacing the infinite scroll with a "More results" button at the bottom of the screen. After viewing the first page of results, users will need to click this button to load the next set of results. This change aims to improve the speed at which results are loaded and to prevent the automatic loading of unnecessary information that users do not explicitly request.

### Benefits of Pagination

Google explains that this shift back to pagination offers several advantages:

**1. Improved Load Times:**
   - Pagination allows Google to prioritize delivering the most relevant results first, potentially improving the speed of initial page loads.

**2. Enhanced User Control:**
   - Users can now see how many results are available and navigate through them more strategically, avoiding the overwhelm of endless scrolling.

**3. Focused Searching:**
   - By encouraging users to pause and assess the relevance of the current page before moving on, pagination leads to more productive searches.

### What This Means for Users

The removal of infinite scrolling should not drastically alter the core search experience. Users will still find the most relevant results at the top but will now have clearer navigation options. For desktop users, this change has already taken effect, and mobile users will soon see the familiar numbered pages and "More results" button.

While it might take some adjustment for those who preferred infinite scrolling, the return to pagination is designed to create a more efficient and user-friendly search experience. As these changes are implemented, users and website owners must adapt to ensure their search strategies and online content remain effective in this evolving digital landscape.
